===========================
Assumptions :
--------------------------

API is open - no authentication is required.

API handles request validation (some validation done in front-end).

API end-point is static.

Numbers are positive integers only.

Length entered is always greater than 1 (hence button says get x Random NumberS).

100 random numbers should be generated and downloaded when user first loads website(based on requirement 2).

Line graph axis y= generated numbers - x= index of number in array of generated numbers.

Download is for the end-user (not a server).
	
File is automatically downloaded when random numbers are generated.

Store numbers as array in txt file.

Requirement 6 (no server post pack) <- assumed this means there is no DB to update?
